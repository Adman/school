LUDO
====

There are 4 players. The game starts with player 0.
The program automatically rolls dice and the user can decide to either
`pass` (not to move any piece), or move specific one.

The winner is the player who reaches `MAX_POINTS` points.

Usage
-----

* `throw` - start another player's turn
* `pass` - skip moving player's pieces
* `move <x>` - move player's piece by number <x>
* `points` - print current standings

Testing
-------

If you want to run small tests, use `$ python3 test.py`
